 *
 * A very simple example showing how to play Live Data with back pressure.
 * It feeds a live stream, waiting that the Futures are completed for each block.
 *
 * This example get the data from an asset file, which is completely stupid :
 * if an App wants to play an asset file he must use "StartPlayerFromBuffer().
 *
 * If you do not need any back pressure, you can see another simple example : "LivePlaybackWithoutbackPressure.dart".
 * This other example is a little bit simpler because the App does not need to await the playback for each block before playing another one.
 * But if you do not use any back pressure, you will be front of two problems :
 * - If your App is too fast feeding the audio channel, it can have problems with the Stream memory used.
 * - The App does not have any knowledge of when the provided block is really played. If he does a "stopPlayer()" it will loose all the buffered data.
