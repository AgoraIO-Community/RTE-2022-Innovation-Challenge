The code of this Demo app is not so simple and unfortunately not very clean :-( .

Flutter Sound beginners : you probably should look to `[SimplePlayback]`  and `[SimpleRecorder]` 

The biggest interest of this Demo is that it shows most of the features of Flutter Sound :

- Plays from various media with various codecs
- Records to various media with various codecs
- Pause and Resume control from recording or playback
- Shows how to use a Stream for getting the playback (or recoding) events
- Shows how to specify a callback function when a playback is terminated,
- Shows how to record to a Stream or playback from a stream
- Can show controls on the iOS or Android lock-screen
- ...

This Demo does not make use of the Flutter Sound UI Widgets.

It would be really great if someone rewrite this demo soon'''),

My own feeling is that this Demo is really too much complicated for doing something very simple.
There is too many dependencies and too many sources.

I really hope that someone will write soon another simpler Demo App.

A very simple example showing how to play Live Data without back pressure.
It feeds a live stream, without waiting that the Futures are completed for each block.
This is simpler because the App does not need to await the playback for each block before playing another one.


This example get the data from an asset file, which is completely stupid :
if an App wants to play an asset file he must use "StartPlayerFromBuffer().

Feeding Flutter Sound without back pressure is very simple but you can have two problems :
- If your App is too fast feeding the audio channel, it can have problems with the Stream memory used.
- The App does not have any knowledge of when the provided block is really played.
If he does a "stopPlayer()" it will loose all the buffered data.

This example uses the ```foodEvent``` object to resynchronize the output stream before doing a ```stop()```
