/// # The Flutter Sound UI controller
///
///The RecorderPlaybackController is a specialised Widget which is used to co-ordinate a paired SoundPlayerUI and a SoundRecorderUI  widgets.
///
///Often when providing an interface to record audio you will want to allow the user to playback the audio after recording it. However you don't want the user to try and start the playback before the recording is complete.
///
///The RecorderPlaybackController widget does not have a UI \(its actually an InheritedWidget\) but rather is used to as a bridge to allow the paired SoundPlayerUI and SoundRecorderUI to communicate with each other.
///
///The RecorderPlaybackController co-ordinates the UI state between the two components so that playback and recording cannot happen at the same time.

/// This class is a Provider style widget designed to

/// so that a user can record and playback in a co-ordinated manner.
///
/// All instances of [SoundRecorderUI] and a [SoundPlayerUI] will
/// search the widget tree looking for a [RecorderPlaybackController].
/// This can cause unintended links. Always place the
/// [RecorderPlaybackController] as close to the [SoundRecorderUI] and
/// [SoundPlayerUI] as possible to avoid unintended links.
///
/// The [RecorderPlaybackController] will disable the [SoundPlayerUI]
/// whilst recording is running and re-enable it once recording has stopped.
///
/// If recording is started whilst the [SoundPlayerUI] is playing then the
/// recorder will cause the playback to stop.
///
/// The [RecorderPlaybackController] will also stream duration
/// updates to the Player so that it can show the duration of the recording
/// as it grows.
